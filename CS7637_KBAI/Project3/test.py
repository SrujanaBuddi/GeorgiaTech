# Your Agent for solving Raven's Progressive Matrices. You MUST modify this file.

# You may also create and submit new files in addition to modifying this file.

# Make sure your file retains methods with the signatures:
# def __init__(self)
# def Solve(self,problem)
#
# These methods will be necessary for the project's main method to run.

    # For each problem, your Agent's Solve() method will be called. At the
    # conclusion of Solve(), your Agent should return an int representing its
    # answer to the question: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Strings of these ints 
    # are also the Names of the individual RavensFigures, obtained through
    # RavensFigure.getName(). Return a negative number to skip a problem.
    #
    # Make sure to return your answer *as an integer* at the end of Solve().
    # Returning your answer as a string may cause your program to crash.
